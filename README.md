This is the output of the test task below:

Please demonstrate your programming skills by writing program as described below.
Task
Given:
Three lists of integers sorted in ascending order. Each integer appears only once in all 3 lists,
that is, if it appears in one list, it does not appear in two other lists. So effectively we have
ascending sequence of numbers broken into three disjoint lists.
To do:
Implement iterator function GetNext() that returns next element in the ascending sequence of
numbers that is the union of these 3 lists.
Use C++ or JS.
Do not build the union explicitly, iterate over the three given lists.
Example:
List 1: 1,8,15,16,35
List 2: 2,7,12,40
List 3: 10,13,14
GetNext() returns: 1
GetNext() returns: 2
GetNext() returns: 7
GetNext() returns: 8
GetNext() returns: 10
GetNext() returns: 12
GetNext() returns: 13
GetNext() returns: 14
GetNext() returns: 15
GetNext() returns: 16
GetNext() returns: 35
GetNext() returns: 40
Rules to follow:
Please note that the test must be completed independently, without relying on any external
knowledge sources or resources. Submitting someone else's solution will not be acceptable. During
future technical testing phases, candidates will be expected to solve similar programming tests in a
supervised, controlled environment at our office.
You can send us your solution in .txt file format.
